## **Prompt engineering vs. context engineering**.

Prompt engineering = crafting the instruction you give the model. 

Context engineering = curating the information the model can see when following that instruction.

## **Understanding Large Language Models.**

Large Language Models are prediction engines that:

•	Take text input (your prompt)

•	Predict the next most likely word/token

•	Continue this process to generate complete responses

•	Base predictions on patterns learned from training data


# **Fundamental Prompting Techniques:**

	Zero-Shot Prompting.

	 One-Shot Prompting.

	 Few-Shot Prompting.

	System Prompting.

	Role Prompting.

	Contextual Prompting.


## **Advanced Prompting Strategies:**

	Step-Back Prompting.

	ReAct (Reasoning + Acting).

	Tree of Thoughts (ToT).

## 1. **Zero-Shot Prompting:**			

	The simplest approach—just ask directly without examples.

Example:

                 Translate this sentence into English:
                         "Main school ja raha hoon."

 ## 2.**One-Shot Prompting:**

	Provide a single example to guide the response format.
Example:

    Translate English to French:

    English: "Hello, how are you?"

    French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"

    English: "Where is the library?"

## 3.**Few-Shot Prompting:**

Few-shot prompting means teaching the AI by showing a few examples first, instead of just giving instructions.

**Example:**

    Sentence: I love this mobile phone.

    Sentiment: Positive

    Sentence: This movie was very boring.

    Sentiment: Negative

    Sentence: The food tastes amazing.

    Sentiment:	

**What happened here?**

•	You gave a few examples

•	The AI learned the pattern

•	Then it answered the new input correctly

## 4.**System Prompting:**

	Set overall context and behavior guidelines.

Example:

    You are a helpful travel guide. Provide practical, accurate information about destinations. Always include:

- Key attractions

- Local customs to be aware of

- Budget considerations

- Best time to visit

User: Tell me about visiting Tokyo.

## 5.**Role Prompting:**

Assign a specific character or expertise to the AI.

Example:

     Act as a technical interviewer. Ask me 5 beginner-level Python questions

Effective roles:

•	Subject matter expert (doctor, lawyer, teacher)

•	Creative roles (writer, designer, poet)

•	Analytical roles (data analyst, consultant)

•	Communication styles (friendly tutor, formal advisor)
 
## 6.**Contextual Prompting:**

Provide specific background information relevant to the task.

Example:

            Context: You're writing for a tech blog aimed at beginners who have never coded before.

    Write a 200-word explanation of what an API is, using simple language and practical examples.
……………………………………………….

Example #02:

         Write a polite and professional email to my instructor asking for a 2-day extension.
         I am a university student. I missed my assignment deadline because I was sick.
Contextual prompting means giving the AI background information or situation (context) before asking your main question, so the response matches the situation correctly.


# **Advanced Prompting Strategies**

 ## **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**:

Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

**EXAMPLE**
          
          Solve this step by step:
          If I was 6 when my sister was half my age, how old is my sister when I'm 40
          

## When to use:

Math problems
Logical reasoning
Complex analysis
Multi-step processes
Best practices:

Use "Let's think step by step" or similar phrases
Set temperature to 0 for consistent reasoning
Extract final answers separately from reasoning


## Self-Consistency:

Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer.

Process:

1.Ask the same question multiple times with different phrasings
2.Compare the answers
3.Choose the most frequently occurring result

**Example:**

    You want to know the best time to study.

    You ask the same question to 4 people:
    

Explanation of Concept: Self-Consistency involves generating multiple answers to the same question using varied reasoning approaches to ensure reliability. By comparing the results, you select the most frequent or consistent outcome, reducing the chance of errors from a single flawed reasoning path

## **Step-Back Prompting**:
Ask a more general question first, then use that context for the specific question.

**EXAMPLE**
        
               PROMPT:  What factors make a vacation enjoyable?”
               RESPONSE: Weather
                         Budget
                         Activities you enjoy
                         Travel time
                         Safety


                 Now you ask:

                “Considering these factors, which vacation spot suits me best?”

Explanation of Concept: Step-Back Prompting involves first asking a broader, foundational question to establish key principles or context before tackling the specific task. This approach ensures the model grounds its response in general knowledge. before applying it to the specific problem. By breaking the task into two steps, the model produces more informed and structured recommendations, reducing the risk of overlooking critical factors.                


## **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**

Combine reasoning with tool use or actions.

**EXAMPLE**
       
         Step 1 – Reason:

         “I want a restaurant nearby. I like Italian food, and it should have good reviews.”

          Step 2 – Act:

          “Search Google Maps for Italian restaurants within 5 km and sort by rating.”

           Step 3 – Reason:

           “The top-rated one has great reviews but is expensive. I want something affordable too.”

             Step 4 – Act:

              “Check menu prices online and pick the one within my budget.”
              
ReAct is a way of solving problems step by step by mixing thinking and doing.

First, you think about what to do next.
Then, you take an action, like searching for information or using a tool.
After that, you look at the result and decide your next step.
This process repeats until the problem is solved.


**Best Practices for Effective Prompts**

## 1. Be Specific and Clear

Bad:

    Write about dogs.
good:

    Write a 300-word informative article about the health benefits of owning a dog, focusing on mental health, physical activity, and social connections. Use a friendly, accessible tone for general readers.

 ## 2. Use Action Verbs

 Be explicit about what you want the AI to do:

Create, Analyze, Describe, Evaluate, Compare
Generate, Extract, Rank, Summarize, List
Explain, Translate, Classify, Write

## 3. Provide Examples When Possible

Examples are the most powerful way to communicate your expectations

## 4. Structure Your Prompts

Use clear formatting:

    Task: [What you want done]
    Context: [Background information]
    Format: [How you want the output structured]
    Example: [Sample of desired output]

## 5. Use Instructions Over Constraints

 Better:

    Write a professional email summarizing the key points from our meeting.

  bad:

      Write an email but don't make it too long or too informal or too detailed.

#  Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

      
## 1. Ambiguous Instructions:
Problem: Vague requests lead to unpredictable outputs 
Solution: Be specific about what you want

## 2. Contradictory Instructions:
Problem: Conflicting requirements confuse the model 
Solution: Review prompts for internal consistency

## 3. Too Many Constraints:
Problem: Over-constraining limits model creativity 
Solution: Focus on positive instructions rather than long lists of don'ts

## 4. Ignoring Token Limits:
Problem: Responses get cut off mid-sentence 
Solution: Set appropriate limits and structure accordingly

## 5. Not Testing Variations:
Problem: Assuming first attempt is optimal 
Solution: Test different phrasings, examples, and approaches

# **Hands-On Examples**

## Example 1: Content Creation

### Task: Create a social media post

Basic prompt:

      Write a social media post about coffee.
Improved prompt:

    Write an engaging Instagram post for a local coffee shop's new seasonal drink. 

    Context: Fall season launch of Pumpkin Spice Maple Latte
    Audience: Coffee enthusiasts aged 25-40
    Tone: Warm, inviting, not overly promotional
    Format: 
    - Main text (150 characters max)
    - 3-5 relevant hashtags
    - Call to action


#  **The Complete AI Prompting Framework: 6-Step Formula for 10x Better Results**

Most people are using AI like ChatGPT entirely wrong. They ask broken questions in new chats without proper context, missing out on AI's true potential. This tutorial will teach you the complete prompting framework that can 10x your productivity and help you get professional-level results from any AI tool.

## **Why Prompting Skills Matter**

In the near future, professionals who master AI prompting will have a significant advantage. We're already seeing:

Doctors using AI to help diagnose patients
Engineers prompting AI to solve complex problems
Lawyers using AI to speed up research and catch missed details
Instead of waiting to be replaced by AI, learn to work with it effectively.

## **The 6-Part Prompting Framework**
This framework works across all major AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and is based on fundamental principles of how large language models operate.

## 1. Command: Start Clearly and Strongly

**Problem**

Most people ask AI questions in a weak or unclear way, so the answers are also weak.

**Solution**

Always start your prompt with a clear command that tells AI exactly what to do.

❌ Bad Example

    Give me investing advice

✅ Good Example

    Recommend a safe investment plan for someone saving to buy a house in 5 years

Simple Rules

Use strong action words like:

analyze
create
design
recommend
explain

Avoid weak words like give or help

## **Be clear and specific**

Sound professional and focused

## **2. Context:**

Give Proper Background

Why Context Matters

If you don’t give background, AI may guess things and go in the wrong direction.

❌ Bad Example

    Recommend an investment strategy

✅ Good Example

    Recommend an investment strategy for a 32-year-old person with medium risk, earning $90,000 per year, who wants to buy a home in 5 years

## **Easy Rule (Rule of Three)
**
Always tell AI:

Who you are (age, job, experience)

What you want (goal, limits)

When you need it (time or deadline)

Context Level

Simple tasks → little context

Big projects → more context

Life decisions → maximum context

## **3. Logic:**

Tell AI How to Respond

**Problem**

If you don’t guide AI, it will answer in its own random format.

**Solution**

Tell AI how to organize the answer.

Example

List the investment types, show percentages, and explain why each one is chosen

Useful Formats You Can Ask For

Table

Bullet points

Checklist

Copy-paste friendly format

Notes format
 
## **4. Roleplay: Turn AI into an Expert**

Why This Works
When you tell AI who it is, the answers become more professional and expert-level.

Simple Example

You are a financial advisor with 15 years of experience

Examples by Field

Finance → Certified financial advisor

Marketing → Senior marketing strategist

Tech → Senior software engineer

Law → Corporate lawyer

**You Can Also Control Style**

Be honest

Be creative

Be practical

Be data-focused

## **5. Formatting: Make the Answer Easy to Use**

Goal

The answer should be clean, clear, and usable.

Example Structure

Ask AI to format like this:

Asset Allocation

Reason for each choice

Risk points

Common Formats

Numbers → steps

Bullets → points

Tables → comparisons

Headings → long topics

Summary → quick understanding

6. Questions: The Most Powerful Step

# **Magic Ending Line**

After writing your full prompt, add this:

Ask me 10 questions to improve this further

Why This Is Powerful

AI finds missing details

Makes answers more personal

Improves quality a lot

Advanced Method
Ask 10 questions
Answer them
Ask 10 more
Stop when questions repeat

**Tip**

Big decisions → answer 20–30 questions

Small tasks → 3–5 questions

Complete Simple Prompt Example

**COMMAND:**
Recommend an investment plan

**CONTEXT:**
for a 32-year-old software engineer with medium risk, earning $90,000/year, saving for a house in 5 years

**LOGIC:**
